Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields using machine learning models, leveraging data such as weather patterns, soil conditions, and agricultural practices.
The model helps to forecast crop production in a sustainable way, assisting farmers, researchers, and policymakers in making informed decisions for better resource management and planning.

Features
Crop Yield Prediction: Predicts crop yield based on environmental, soil, and historical crop data.
Sustainability: Focuses on optimizing crop production with minimal environmental impact.
Machine Learning Models: Implements machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Data Visualization: Visualizes data trends and model predictions for better interpretation and decision-making.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, feature selection, and scaling for optimal model performance.

Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for developing machine learning models.
pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For creating and running the project in an interactive environment.
